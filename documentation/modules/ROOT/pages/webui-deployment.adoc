= Deploy Web UI with with Node.js and AngularJS
:navtitle: Deploy Web UI with with Node.js and AngularJS

_10 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about Node.js and will deploy the Node.js and Angular-based 
web frontend for the CoolStore online shop which uses the API Gateway services you deployed 
in previous labs.

== What is Node.js?

https://nodejs.org/[Node.js^] is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side 
applications using JavaScript. https://nodejs.org/[Node.js^] has an event-driven architecture capable of 
non-blocking I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in 
Web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time web applications.

https://nodejs.org/[Node.js^] non-blocking architecture allows applications to process large number of 
requests (tens of thousands) using a single thread which makes it desirable choice for building 
scalable web applications.

[#deploy_on_openshift]
== Deploy on OpenShift

The Web UI is built using Node.js for server-side JavaScript and AngularJS for client-side 
JavaScript. Let's deploy it on OpenShift using the certified Node.js container image available 
in OpenShift. 

In this lab, again you will use OpenShift https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/cicd/builds/understanding-image-builds.html[Source-to-Image (S2I)^].
OpenShift will obtain the application code directly from the source repository then build and deploy a 
container image of it.

For a change, rather than using the CLI option you will start this process from the web console.

In the OpenShift Web Console, from the **Developer view**,
`*click on '+Add' and select 'Import from Git'*`

Then, enter the following information:

.Web UI Project
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter 
|Value

|Git Repo URL
|\https://github.com/RedHat-EMEA-SSA-TEAM/end-to-end-developer-workspace.git

|Git Reference (see *advanced Git options*)
|**{WORKSHOP_GIT_REF}**

|Context Dir
|**/labs/web-nodejs**

|Builder Image
|**Node.js**

|Application
|**coolstore**

|Name
|**web-coolstore**

|Create a route to the application
|**_Checked_**

|Show advanced Routing options
|**_Expand - see below_**

|===

From the advanced Routing options `*de-select the Secure Route option*`, so this creates an *HTTP* route
like below:-

`*Click on 'Create' button*` 

Now wait a few minutes for the application to built by OpenShift and deployed to your project. In the toplogy view, 
the web application pod will not be ready until the blue ring goes dark blue.

[#test_your_service]
== Test your Service

In the OpenShift Web Console, from the **Developer view**,
`*click on the 'Open URL' icon of the Web Service*`

Your browser will be redirected to **your Web Service running on OpenShift**.
You should be able to see the CoolStore application with all products and their inventory status.

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
