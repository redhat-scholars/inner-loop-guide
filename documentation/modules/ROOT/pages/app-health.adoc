_20 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab we will learn how to monitor application health using OpenShift 
health probes and how you can see container resource consumption using metrics.

.OpenShift Health Probes
--

When building microservices, monitoring becomes of extreme importance to make sure all services 
are running at all times, and when they don't there are automatic actions triggered to rectify 
the issues. 

OpenShift, using Kubernetes health probes, offers a solution for monitoring application 
health and trying to automatically heal faulty containers through restarting them to fix issues such as
a deadlock in the application which can be resolved by restarting the container. Restarting a container 
in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.

Furthermore, there are of course a category of issues that can't be resolved by restarting the container. 
In those scenarios, OpenShift would remove the faulty container from the built-in load-balancer and send traffic 
only to the healthy containers that remain.

There are three types of health probes available in OpenShift: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/applications/application-health.html#application-health-about_application-health[startup, readiness and liveness probes^]. 

* **Startup probes** determine if the container in which it is scheduled is started
* **Readiness probes** determine if the container in which it is scheduled is ready to service requests
* **Liveness probes** determine if the container in which it is scheduled is still running


Health probes also provide crucial benefits when automating deployments with practices like rolling updates in 
order to remove downtime during deployments. A readiness health probe would signal OpenShift when to switch 
traffic from the old version of the container to the new version so that the users don't get affected during 
deployments.

There are https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/applications/application-health.html#application-health-about_types_application-health[three ways to define a health probe^] for a container:

* **HTTP Checks:** healthiness of the container is determined based on the response code of an HTTP 
endpoint. Anything between 200 and 399 is considered success. A HTTP check is ideal for applications 
that return HTTP status codes when completely initialized.

* **Container Execution Checks:** a specified command is executed inside the container and the healthiness is 
determined based on the return value (0 is success). 

* **TCP Socket Checks:** a socket is opened on a specified port to the container and it's considered healthy 
only if the check can establish a connection. TCP socket check is ideal for applications that do not 
start listening until initialization is complete.

[#understanding_liveness]
==  Understanding Liveness Probes

**What happens if you DON'T setup Liveness checks?**

By default Pods are designed to be resilient, if a pod dies it will get restarted. Let's see
this happening.

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^, role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Topology' -> '(D) inventory-coolstore' -> 'Resources' -> 'P inventory-coolstore-x-xxxxx'*`

image::openshift-inventory-pod.png[OpenShift Inventory Pod, 700]

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^, role='params-link'], `*click on 'Actions' -> 'Delete Pod' -> 'Delete'*`

image::openshift-inventory-delete-pod.png[OpenShift Inventory Delete Pod, 700]

A new instance (pod) will be redeployed very quickly. Once deleted `*try to access your http://inventory-coolstore-my-project{USER_ID}.{APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX}[Inventory Service^, role='params-link']*`.

However, imagine the _Inventory Service_ is stuck in a state (Stopped listening, Deadlock, etc)
where it cannot perform as it should. In this case, the pod will not immeditaely die, it will be in a zombie state.

To make your application more robust and reliable, a **Liveness check**  will be used to check 
if the container itself has become unresponsive. If the liveness probe fails due to a condition such as a deadlock, 
the container could automatically restart (based on its restart policy).

[#understanding_readiness]
==  Understanding Readiness Probes

**What happens if you DON'T setup Readiness checks?**

Let's imagine you have traffic coming into the _Inventory Service_. We can do that with simple script.

In your {CHE_URL}[Workspace^, role='params-link'],

[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====

IDE Task::
+
-- 
`*Click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'devfile: Inventory - Generate Traffic'*`

`*Execute the following commands in the terminal window*`

----
for i in {1..60}
do 
    if [ $(curl -s -w "%{http_code}" -o /dev/null http://inventory-coolstore.my-project{USER_ID}.svc:8080/api/inventory/329299) == "200" ]
    then 
        MSG="\033[0;32mThe request to Inventory Service has succeeded\033[0m"
    else 
        MSG="\033[0;31mERROR - The request to Inventory Service has failed\033[0m" 
    fi
    
    echo -e $MSG
    sleep 1s
done
----

NOTE: To open a terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'New Terminal'*`

You should have the following output:

image::che-inventory-traffic.png[Che - Catalog Traffic OK, 500]

Now let's scale out your _Inventory Service_ to 2 instances. 

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^, role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Topology' -> '(D) inventory-coolstore' -> 'Details' then click once on the up arrows 
on the right side of the pod blue circle*`.

image::openshift-scale-out-inventory.png[OpenShift Scale Out Catalog, 700]

You should see the 2 instances (pods) running. 
Now, `*switch back to your {CHE_URL}[Workspace^, role='params-link'] and check the output of the 'Inventory Generate Traffic' task*`.

image::che-inventory-traffic-ko.png[Che - Catalog Traffic KO, 500]

**Why do some requests failed? Because as soon as the container is created, the traffic is sent to this new instance even if the application is not ready.** 
(The _Inventory Service_ takes a few seconds to start up). 

In order to prevent this behaviour, a **Readiness check** is needed. It determines if the container is ready to service requests. 
If the readiness probe fails, the endpoints controller ensures the container has its IP address removed from the endpoints of all services. 
A readiness probe can be used to signal to the endpoints controller that even though a container is running, it should not receive any traffic from a proxy.

First, scale down your _Inventory Service_ to 1 instance. In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^, role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Topology' -> '(D) inventory-coolstore' -> 'Details' then click once on the down arrows 
on the right side of the pod blue circle*`.

Now lets go fix some of these problems.

[#configuring_liveness]
== Configuring Liveness Probes

https://quarkus.io/guides/health-guide[SmallRye Health^] is a Quarkus extension which utilizes the MicroProfile Health specification.
It allows applications to provide information about their state to external viewers which is typically useful 
in cloud environments where automated processes must be able to determine whether the application should be discarded or restarted.

Let's add the needed dependencies to **/projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus/pom.xml**. 
In your {CHE_URL}[Workspace^, role='params-link'], `*edit the '/projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus/pom.xml' file*`:

[source,xml,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-health</artifactId>
    </dependency>
----

Then, `*build and push the updated Inventory Service to the OpenShift cluster*`.

[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====

IDE Task::
+
-- 
`*Click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'devfile: Inventory - Push Component'*`

image::che-runtask.png[Che - RunTask, 600]
--

CLI::
+
--
`*Execute the following commands in the terminal window*`

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
cd /projects/workshop/labs/inventory-quarkus
mvn package -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true -DskipTests -Dquarkus.container-image.group=$(oc project -q)
----

NOTE: To open a terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'New Terminal'*`
--
====

Wait till the build is complete then, `*Delete the Inventory Pod*` to make it start again with the new code.

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
oc delete pod -l component=inventory -n my-project{USER_ID}
----

It will take a few seconds to retstart, then verify that the health endpoint works for the **Inventory Service** using `*curl*`

In your {CHE_URL}[Workspace^, role='params-link'], 
`*execute the following commands in the terminal window*` - it may take a few attempts while the pod restarts.

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
curl -w "\n" http://inventory-coolstore.my-project{USER_ID}.svc:8080/q/health
----

NOTE: To open a terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'New Terminal'*`

You should have the following output:

[source,json,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
{
    "status": "UP",
    "checks": [
        {
            "name": "Database connection(s) health check",
            "status": "UP"
        }
    ]
}
----

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^, role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Topology' -> '(D) inventory-coolstore' -> 'Add Health Checks'*`.

image::openshift-inventory-add-health-check.png[Che - Inventory Add Health Check, 700]

Then `*click on 'Add Liveness Probe'*`

image::openshift-inventory-add-liveness-probe.png[Che - Inventory Add Liveness Probe, 500]

`*Enter the following information:*`

.Liveness Probe
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter 
|Value

|Type
|HTTP GET

|Use HTTPS
|_Unchecked_

|HTTP Headers
|_Empty_

|Path
|/q/health/live

|Port
|8080

|Failure Threshold
|3

|Success Threshold
|1

|Initial Delay
|10

|Period
|10

|Timeout
|1

|===

Finally `*click on the check icon*`. But don't click *Add* yet, we have more probes to configure.

[#configuring_readiness]
==  Configuring Inventory Readiness Probes

Now repeat the same task for the *Inventory* service, but this time set the *Readiness* probes:

.Readiness Probe
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Parameter
|Value

|Type
|HTTP GET

|Use HTTPS
|_Unchecked_

|HTTP Headers
|_Empty_

|Path
|/q/health/ready

|Port
|8080

|Failure Threshold
|3

|Success Threshold
|1

|Initial Delay
|0

|Period
|5

|Timeout
|1

|===

Finally `*click on the check icon and the 'Add' button*`. OpenShift automates deployments using 
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.12/welcome/index.html[deployment triggers^] 
that react to changes to the container image or configuration. 
Therefore, as soon as you define the probe, OpenShift automatically redeploys the pod using the new configuration including the liveness probe.


[#testing_Readiness]
== Testing Inventory Readiness Probes

Now let's test it as you did previously.
`*Generate traffic to Inventory Service*` and then, in the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^, role='params-link'], 
`*scale out the Inventory Service to 2 instances (pods)*`

In your {CHE_URL}[Workspace^, role='params-link'], `*check the output of the 'Inventory Generate Traffic' task*`.

You should not see any errors, this means that you can now **scale out your _Inventory Service_ with no downtime.**

image::che-inventory-traffic.png[Che - Catalog Traffic OK, 500]

Now scale down your _Inventory Service_ back to 1 instance. 

== Catalog Services Probes

http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#production-ready[Spring Boot Actuator^] is a 
sub-project of Spring Boot which adds health and management HTTP endpoints to the application. Enabling Spring Boot 
Actuator is done via adding **org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator** dependency to the Maven project 
dependencies which is already done for the **Catalog Service**.

Verify that the health endpoint works for the **Catalog Service** using `*curl*`.

In your {CHE_URL}[Workspace^, role='params-link'], in the *terminal* window, 
`*execute the following commands*`:

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
curl -w "\n" http://catalog-coolstore.my-project{USER_ID}.svc:8080/actuator/health
----

You should have the following output:

[source,json,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
{"status":"UP"}
----

Liveness and Readiness health checks values have already been set for this service as part of the build and deploying 
using Eclipse JKube in combination with the Spring Boot actuator. 

You can check this in the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^, role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Topology' -> '(D) catalog-coolstore' -> 'Actions' -> 'Edit Health Checks'*`.

image::openshift-catalog-edit-health.png[Che - Catalog Add Health Check, 700]

[#understanding_startup]
==  Understanding Startup Probes

**Startup probes** are similar to liveness probes but only executed at startup.
When a startup probe is configured, the other probes are disabled until it suceeds.

Sometimes, some (legacy) applications might need extra times for their first initialization. 
In such cases, setting a longer liveness internal might compromise the main benefit of this probe ie providing 
the fast response to stuck states.

**Startup probes** are useful to cover this worse case startup time.

[#monitoring_all_applications]
== Monitoring All Application Healths

Now you understand and know how to configure Readiness, Liveness and Startup probes, let's confirm your expertise! 

`*Configure the remaining Probes for Inventory and Catalog*` using the following information:

.Startup Probes
[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Inventory Service
|Startup

|Type
|HTTP GET

|Use HTTPS
|_Unchecked_

|HTTP Headers
|_Empty_

|Path
|/q/health/live

|Port
|8080

|Failure Threshold
|3

|Success Threshold
|1

|Initial Delay
|0

|Period
|5

|Timeout
|1

|===

[%header,cols=2*]
|===
|Catalog Service
|Startup

|Type
|HTTP GET

|Use HTTPS
|_Unchecked_

|HTTP Headers
|_Empty_

|/actuator/health

|Port
|8080

|Failure Threshold
|15

|Success Threshold
|1

|Initial Delay

|===

Finally, let's configure probes for Gateway and Web Service.
In your {CHE_URL}[Workspace^, role='params-link'], `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'devfile: Probes - Configure Gateway & Web'*`

image::che-runtask.png[Che - RunTask, 600]

[#monitoring_application_metrics]
== Monitoring Applications Metrics

Metrics are another important aspect of monitoring applications which is required in order to 
gain visibility into how the application behaves and particularly in identifying issues.

OpenShift provides container metrics out-of-the-box and displays how much memory, cpu and network 
each container has been consuming over time. 

In the {OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}[OpenShift Web Console^, role='params-link'], from the **Developer view**,
`*click on 'Observe' then select your 'my-project{USER_ID}' project*`.

In the project overview, you can see the different **Resource Usage** sections. 
`*click on one graph to get more details*`.

image::openshift-monitoring.png[OpenShift Monitoring,740]

From the **Developer view**, `*click on 'Topology' -> any Deployment (D) and click on the associated Pod (P)*`

In the pod overview, you can see a more detailed view of the pod consumption.
The graphs can be found under the Metrics heading, or Details in earlier versions of the OpenShift console.

image::openshift-pod-details.png[OpenShift Pod Details,740]

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
