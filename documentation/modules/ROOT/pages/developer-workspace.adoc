= Get your Developer Workspace
:navtitle: Get your Developer Workspace

_10 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about providing your Developer Workspace with a Kubernetes-native development platform 
and getting familiar with the OpenShift CLI and OpenShift Web Console.

[#what_is_codeready_workspaces]
== What is Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces?

.Red Hat OpenShift DevSpaces
****
[window=_blank, align="center"]
https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^] is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform.

As an open-source project, the core goals of https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  are to:

* **Accelerate project and developer onboarding:** As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project.
* **Remove inconsistency between developer environments:** No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment.
* **Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness:** As https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines.

To achieve those core goals, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  provides:

* **Workspaces:** Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications.
* **Browser-based IDEs:** Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tooling, debuggers, terminal, source control (SCM) integration, and much more.
* **Extensible platform:** Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plug-ins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions.
* **Enterprise Integration:** Multi-user capabilities, including Keycloak for authentication and integration with LDAP or AD.

[#get_your_developer_workspace]
== Getting your Developer Workspace with a single click

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^]  will provide you an out-of-the-box 
*Developer Workspace* with all the tools and the dependencies we need to do the job. **And with only one single click!**

[NOTE]
.Devfile
====
https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^] uses https://docs.devfile.io/devfile/index.html[Devfiles^] to automate the provisioning of a specific workspace by defining:

* projects to clone
* browser IDE to use
* preconfigured commands
* tools that you need
* application runtime definition

Providing a {WORKSHOP_GIT_REPO}/blob/{WORKSHOP_GIT_REF}/devfile.yaml[devfile.yaml^] file inside a Git source repository signals to https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-dev-spaces[OpenShift Dev Spaces^] to configure the project and runtime according 
to this file.

`*Click on the 'Developer Workspace' button below*`
// precreated workspace, we escape the - to get the URL userX-devspaces to work around an antora bug
[link={CHE_URL}/dashboard/#/ide/user{USER_ID}%2Ddevspaces/wksp-end-to-end-dev]

Then `*Click 'Log in with OpenShift'*`

image::login-with-openshift.png[OpenShift - Login, 500]

Then `*login as user{USER_ID}/{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}*.`

image::che-login.png[Che - Login, 500]

Now there are a couple of steps before we can get started. Firstly you need to `*Trust*` the Git source you need to import for this workshop

image::vscode-trust.png[Che - Workspace, 500]

Then you need to accept or select the Visual Studio Code UI Settings. You can just click `*Mark Done*` to skip these.

image::vscode-settings.png[Che - Workspace, 500]

Once completed, you will have a fully functional Browser-based IDE within the source code already imported.

[#connect_your_workspace]
== Connect Your Workspace to Your OpenShift User

First, in your {CHE_URL}[Workspace^, role='params-link'],

[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====

IDE Task::
+
-- 
`*Click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'devfile: OpenShift - Login'*`

image::che-runtask.png[Che - RunTask, 600]
--

CLI::
+
--
`*Execute the following commands in the terminal window*`

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
oc login $(oc whoami --show-server) --username=user{USER_ID} --password={OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD} --insecure-skip-tls-verify
oc project my-project{USER_ID} 2> /dev/null
----

NOTE: To open a terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'New Terminal'*`

--
====

The output should be as follows:

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <projectname>':

  * cn-project{USER_ID}
    user{USER_ID} -devspaces

Using project "user{USER_ID} -devspaces".
----

Then, create your **Development Environment**:

[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====

IDE Task::
+
-- 
`*Click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'devfile: OpenShift - Create Development Project'*`

image::che-runtask.png[Che - RunTask, 600]
--

CLI::
+
--
`*Execute the following commands in the terminal window*`

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
oc new-project my-project{USER_ID}
----

NOTE: To open a terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'New Terminal'*`
--
====

The output should be as follows:

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
 Now using project "my-project{USER_ID}" on server "https://172.30.0.1:443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname
----

[#login_to_openshift]
== Log in to the OpenShift Developer Console

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to
perform various tasks via a browser.

`*Click on the 'Developer Console' button below*`

[link={OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}]
[window=_blank, align="center"]
[role='params-link']
image::developer-console-button.png[Developer Workspace - Button, 300]

`*Enter your username and password (user{USER_ID}/{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD})*` and 
then log in. After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a
list of projects that your user has permission to work with. 

`*Select the 'Developer View' then your 'my-project{USER_ID}'*` to be taken to the project overview page
which will list all of the routes, services, deployments, and pods that you have
running as part of your project. There's nothing there now, but that's about to
change.
