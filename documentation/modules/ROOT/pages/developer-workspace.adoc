= Get your Developer Workspace
:navtitle: Get your Developer Workspace

_10 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about providing your Developer Workspace with a Kubernetes-native development platform 
and getting familiar with the OpenShift CLI and OpenShift Web Console.

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^] is a Kubernetes-native IDE and developer collaboration platform.

As an open-source project, the core goals of https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  are to:

* **Accelerate project and developer onboarding:** As a zero-install development environment that runs in your browser, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  makes it easy for anyone to join your team and contribute to a project.
* **Remove inconsistency between developer environments:** No more: “But it works on my machine.” Your code works exactly the same way in everyone’s environment.
* **Provide built-in security and enterprise readiness:** As https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  becomes a viable replacement for VDI solutions, it must be secure and it must support enterprise requirements, such as role-based access control and the ability to remove all source code from developer machines.

To achieve those core goals, https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  provides:

* **Workspaces:** Container-based developer workspaces providing all the tools and dependencies needed to code, build, test, run, and debug applications.
* **Browser-based IDEs:** Bundled browser-based IDEs with language tooling, debuggers, terminal, VCS integration, and much more.
* **Extensible platform:** Bring your own IDE. Define, configure, and extend the tools that you need for your application by using plug-ins, which are compatible with Visual Studio Code extensions.
* **Enterprise Integration:** Multi-user capabilities, including Keycloak for authentication and integration with LDAP or AD.

[#get_your_developer_workspace]
== Getting your Developer Workspace with a single click

https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^]  will provide you an out-of-box 
*Developer Workspace* with all the tools and the dependencies we need to do the job. **And with only one single click!**

[NOTE]
.Devfile
====
https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^] uses https://docs.devfile.io/devfile/index.html[Devfiles^] to automate the provisioning of a specific workspace by defining:

* projects to clone
* browser IDE to use
* preconfigured commands
* tools that you need
* application runtime definition

Providing a https://github.com/mcouliba/cloud-native-workshop/blob/ocp4.6/devfile.yaml[devfile.yaml^] file inside a Git source repository signals to https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-codeready-workspaces[CodeReady Workspaces^] to configure the project and runtime according 
to this file.
====

`*Click on the 'Developer Workspace' button below*`

Then `*login as user{USER_ID}/{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD}*` and let the magic happens...

Once completed, you will have a fully functional Browser-based IDE within the source code already imported.

[#what_is_odo]
== What is OpenShift Do (odo)?

[sidebar]
.OpenShift Do (odo)
--

https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/understanding-odo.html[OpenShift Do (odo)^] is a CLI tool for creating applications on OpenShift Container Platform and Kubernetes. 
With https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/understanding-odo.html[odo^], you can write, build, and debug applications on a cluster without the need to administer the cluster itself. 
Creating deployment configurations, build configurations, service routes and other OpenShift Container Platform or Kubernetes elements are all automated by https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/understanding-odo.html[odo^].

Existing tools such as https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html[OpenShift CLI (oc)^] are operations-focused and require a deep understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift Container Platform concepts. 
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/developer_cli_odo/understanding-odo.html[odo^] abstracts away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift Container Platform concepts allowing developers to focus on what is most important to them: **code**.

[#connect_your_workspace]
== Connect Your Workspace to Your OpenShift User

First, in your {CHE_URL}[Workspace^, role='params-link'],

[tabs, subs="attributes+,+macros"]
====

IDE Task::
+
-- 
`*Click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'OpenShift - Login'*`

image::che-runtask.png[Che - RunTask, 500]
--

CLI::
+
--
`*Execute the following commands in the '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window*`

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
odo login $(oc whoami --show-server) --username=user{USER_ID} --password={OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD} --insecure-skip-tls-verify
----

NOTE: To open a '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Open Terminal in specific container' ->  'workshop-tools'*`

--
====

The output should be as follows:

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
Connecting to the OpenShift cluster

Login successful.

You have one project on this server: "cn-project{USER_ID}"

Using project "cn-project{USER_ID}".

Welcome! See 'odo help' to get started.
----

Then, create your **Development Environment**:

IDE Task::
+
-- 
`*Click on 'Terminal' -> 'Run Task...' ->  'OpenShift - Create Development Project'*`

image::che-runtask.png[Che - RunTask, 500]

CLI::
+
--
`*Execute the following commands in the '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window*`

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}",role=copypaste]
----
odo project create my-project{USER_ID}
----

NOTE: To open a '>_ workshop_tools' terminal window, `*click on 'Terminal' -> 'Open Terminal in specific container' ->  'workshop-tools'*`
--
====

The output should be as follows:

[source,shell,subs="{markup-in-source}"]
----
 ✓  Project 'my-project{USER_ID}' is ready for use
 ✓  New project created and now using project: my-project{USER_ID}
----

[#login_to_openshift]
== Log in to the OpenShift Developer Console

OpenShift ships with a web-based console that will allow users to
perform various tasks via a browser.

`*Click on the 'Developer Console' button below*`

[link={OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}]
[window=_blank, align="center"]
[role='params-link']
image::developer-console-button.png[Developer Workspace - Button, 300]

`*Enter your username and password (user{USER_ID}/{OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD})*` and 
then log in. After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with a
list of projects that your user has permission to work with. 

`*Select the 'Developer View' then your 'my-project{USER_ID}'*` to be taken to the project overview page
which will list all of the routes, services, deployments, and pods that you have
running as part of your project. There's nothing there now, but that's about to
change.
